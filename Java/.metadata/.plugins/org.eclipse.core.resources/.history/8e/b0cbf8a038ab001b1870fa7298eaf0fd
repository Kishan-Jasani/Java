package Java;
//In Java, a class can contain another class known as nested class. 
//It's possible to create a nested class without giving any name. 
//A nested class that doesn't have any name is known as an anonymous class. 
//Anonymous classes usually extend subclasses or implement interfaces.

//A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
//Lambda expressions are similar to methods, 
//but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
