----> OOP:-
-- Object-oriented programming System(OOPs) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” that contain data and methods. 
-- The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs.


# Class and Object:-
# --> A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind.
# --> Class means type of Objects.
# --> An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.

# --> Objects are real world entities. Anything you can describe in this world is an object. 
# --> Classes on the other hand are not real. They are just a concept. Class is a short form of Classification. 
# --> A class is a classification of certain objects and it is just a description of the properties and behavior all objects of that classification should possess.

# For Example:-
# --> Class is a like a recipe and the object is like the cupcake we bake using it. 
# --> All cupcakes created from a recipe share similar characteristics like shape, sweetness, etc. But they are all unique as well. One cupcake may have strawberry frosting while another might have vanilla.
# -->  Similarly, Objects of a class share similar characteristics but they differ in their values for those characteristics.

# For Example:-
# --> Let Suppose, we have 10 pens with different color, size and shape and 8 bottles with different weight and size.
# --> What do you think? How many Objects and Type of Objects(Classes) we have?
# --> We have total 18 Objects here including 10 pens and 8 bottles.
# --> We have total 2 Type of Objects(Classes) here, Pen and Bottle
