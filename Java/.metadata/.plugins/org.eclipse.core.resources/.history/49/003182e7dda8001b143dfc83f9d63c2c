--> Interpreter 
---- translates one statement at a time into machine code.
---- interpreter needed everytime
---- Partial execution till error occurs
---- easy to use



--> Compiler 
---- scans entire program and translates whole of it into machine code
---- compiler is not required once compiled
---- no execution if error occurs
---- not as easy as compiler
