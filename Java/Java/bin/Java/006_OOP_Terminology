----> Abstraction:-
-- Through the process of abstraction in Java, a programmer can hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
-- Hiding internal details (Shows only essential information)
	e.g. 
	Abstraction is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it. 
	For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget. 
	Along with the gadget, you get a user guide, instructing how to use the application, but this user guide has no info regarding the internal working of the gadget.
	Another example is, when you use TV remote, you do not know how pressing a key in the remote changes the channel internally on the TV. 
	You just know that pressing volume key will increase the volume.

	
----> Encapsulation:-
-- Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines
-- Encapsulation means that the sensitive data can be hidden from the user.
-- Encapsulated method can not be accessible outside the class without getter setter.


----> Inheritance(is-A):-
-- Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
-- Smart Phone is a Phone
-- feature Phone is a Phone


----> Polymorphism(Method Overriding):-
-- One entity many forms
-- Sometimes a child may not want to use what it has inherited from the parent. 
-- The same holds true for OOP as well. 
-- If the child class does not want to use a method inherited from the parent class then it may create its own method with the same name.
-- When the child has a method with the same name as that of the parent, it is said to override the parent’s method. 
-- This is called as Method Overriding. 
-- Method overriding is also called as Polymorphism.
